# Creative Ideation Framework

> When asked to brainstorm, ideate, or explore ideas — use this framework BEFORE writing any code or stories.

---

## TRIGGER WORDS

When the user says any of these, activate ideation mode:
- "ideate"
- "brainstorm"
- "what are all the ways"
- "how might we"
- "in what ways might"
- "let's explore"
- "what if"

---

## PHASE 1: UNDERSTAND (Ask First)

Before generating ideas, ask:

1. **"What problem are we really solving?"**
   - Get to the root cause, not the symptom

2. **"Who is this for, and what do they care about most?"**
   - Understand the user's real motivation

3. **"What does success look like?"**
   - Define the win before exploring solutions

4. **"What constraints do we have?"**
   - Time, budget, technical, or business limits

---

## PHASE 2: DIVERGE (Expand Possibilities)

Generate multiple options using these prompts:

### Quantity Questions
- "What are 10 different ways we could approach this?"
- "What are 3 simple solutions and 3 ambitious ones?"
- "What would we build if we had 1 day vs 1 month?"

### Perspective Shifts
- "How would Apple/Amazon/Stripe solve this?"
- "What would a non-technical person expect?"
- "What would our biggest competitor do?"
- "What's the opposite approach — could it work?"

### Simplification
- "What's the simplest version that delivers value?"
- "What can we remove and still solve the problem?"
- "How would we do this with no new code?"
- "What existing feature could we extend?"

### Amplification
- "What would make this a 'wow' moment?"
- "How could this be 10x better than expected?"
- "What would make someone tell a friend?"

---

## PHASE 3: CONVERGE (Narrow Down)

After generating ideas, evaluate with:

### Feasibility
- "Which options can we build with what we have?"
- "What's the effort vs impact for each?"
- "Which has the fewest dependencies?"

### User Value
- "Which option solves the user's problem best?"
- "Which delivers value fastest?"
- "Which creates the least friction?"

### Risk
- "What could go wrong with each approach?"
- "Which option is easiest to change later?"
- "What's the worst user experience this could create?"

---

## PHASE 4: DECIDE (Pick a Direction)

Summarize:

1. **Top recommendation** — and why
2. **Runner-up option** — and when it might be better
3. **What we're NOT doing** — and why

Then ask: **"Should I write user stories for this approach?"**

---

## RULES FOR IDEATION MODE

1. **No code yet** — explore before building
2. **Quantity first** — generate many ideas before judging
3. **Ask, don't assume** — clarify before solving
4. **User focus** — always tie back to who benefits
5. **Document the decision** — capture why we chose this path

## OUTPUT FORMAT

After ideation, summarize in this format:
